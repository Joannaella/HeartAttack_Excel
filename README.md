This dataset delves into the realm of heart diseases, encompassing 13 distinct features that delineate patient profiles. Among these attributes are age, gender, chest pain classification, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, electrocardiogram readings, maximum heart rate, and the presence of exercise-induced angina, among others.

Following this, I've meticulously conducted preliminary data preprocessing to refine and prepare the dataset for analysis. Furthermore, I've crafted an interactive dashboard utilizing pivot tables, aiming to offer a holistic depiction of the dataset's nuances. These pivot tables facilitate dynamic exploration across diverse dimensions, including age distributions, gender disparities, various chest pain types, and their intricate relationships with factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
